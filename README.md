# Weather Dashboard


## Description

In order to both demonstrate and improve the knowledge and skills required for working with third party APIs, students are tasked with creating a weather dashboard using the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API portfolio alongside HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements

A user must be able to access the page and enter the name of a city.  The application must do the following in response:

* Return valid weather data for the entered location (using an OpenWeather API)
* Display valid weather data for the entered location for:

	- Current day (ie *date the user executes the city submission*)
	- Each day after the current day, for five days ("5-Day Forecast")
	- List of cities that were previously forecasted (*stored in and recalled from local storage*)
		- Each of the city names listed must be clickable to execute a new forecast call

## Future Enhancements

* Implement API key
